# etckeeper-packages

This is an alternative [pug][pug] and [pacmanity][pacmanity] that assumes [etckeeper][etckeeper] is being used to version control the entire `/etc` directory. Rather than having to upload to a Gist, just updating a file is sufficient. The mechanism to back this up to a remote git server is provided by `etckeeper`.

## Installation
